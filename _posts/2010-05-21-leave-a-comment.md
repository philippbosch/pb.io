Tonight will be the opening reception of a group exhibition called **«Locate Me»** at the [Kunstraum Kreuzberg](http://www.kunstraumkreuzberg.de/prog_2.html) inside the Künstlerhaus Bethanien. My dear office mates [Patrick and Dennis](http://the-product.org/) will show their project [«Leave a Comment»](http://the-product.org/leave-a-comment-toolkit) there.

The main intention of this project is to cast an invisible layer of subjective, unauthored information on public space.

> To achieve this, we hand out prepared «toolkits», comprised of an
> ultraviolet-fluorescent pen (UV-pen), a speech-bubble-shaped stencil,
> and an ultraviolet-torch (UV-torch). The UV-pen and the stencil 
> function as the «authoring tool» while the UV-torch plays the role of
> the «imaging device». The UV-pen works in a way that allows for
> leaving a message on a surface, invisible to the human eye, until the
> message is illuminated with the UV-torch, revealing it fluorescing,
> temporarily visible to the human eye.
> 
> Equipped with the toolkit participants now tag, flag, or comment on
> things, spaces and places by invisibly but physically writing or
> drawing on them. Eventually the invisible layer grows into a secret
> parallel world, with messages potentially lurking in corners,
> comments unknowingly on display right in front of one's face,
> subversively augmenting public space.

Also part of this project is an [iPhone app](http://lacmap.com/) that helps people find tagged spots around the city and also file spots that they tagged themselves making it easier for others to find those. I built this app based on HTML5 technology and a [CouchDB](http://couchdb.org/) server component for storing the spots.
