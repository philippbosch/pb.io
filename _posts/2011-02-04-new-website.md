This feels like the 5259831th time that I try to create a website for myself. Why is it so difficult to apply the skills I use every day for client work to my own website? I don't know. The books say «Release early. Release often.» And that is what I'm going to do now. Get something out there. Even if it's still far from where I want it to be. But I'm working on it. Enjoy.
