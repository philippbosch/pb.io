title: Consume iCalendar data as JSON
---

While building this website I wanted to incorporate an overview of conferences that I'm going to. The data is already out there at [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/people/philippbosch) but unfortunately there is no API yet. There are [badges](http://lanyrd.com/services/badges/) available to embed in your site but that didn't cut it for me. 

I then saw that they are offering iCalendar files on the [calendar page](http://lanyrd.com/calendar/yours/) (in the end it turned out not to be what I want because this data also includes conferences that I'm *tracking* and not only those I'm *attending*, but that's another story). Maybe I could take advantage of this somehow using [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/). Turns out you can consume Atom, RSS, CSV, and tons of other formats, but no luck with iCalendar data.

So I sat down and put together a tiny web service that pulls in iCalendar data from a URL and converts it to JSON. Here's how to use it:

`http://ical2json.pb.io/the-website.com/path/to/file.ics`

<!--more-->

So for example let's take some events from [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/). They provide iCalendar data at URLs like this: `http://ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/Shout+Out+Louds/events.ics`.

To get this data in JSON format use a URL like this: `http://ical2json.pb.io/ws.audioscrobbler.com/1.0/artist/Shout+Out+Louds/events.ics`

The response will look like this:

Of course there's also support for JSON-P callbacks (?callback=foo).
