Quite often I find myself looking at a browser I'm not 100% familiar
with and wondering which of the fancy new HTML5 oder CSS3 features does
it support. Does IE9 support SVG – or do I need to use a 
[polyfill](https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-browser-Polyfills)? 
Can I use the Geolocation API in Opera?

Until recently what I did was simply go to the 
[Modernizr](http://www.modernizr.com/) website because on the frontpage
they had this table of features they are able to detect with their
awesome library, and next to each a green checkmark if the browser you 
were using supports this feature.

Well, with the relase of [Modernizr 2](http://www.modernizr.com/news/modernizr-2)
came a new website and sadly the feature table disappeared completely.
I don't know why they did that or if it will ever come back.

**Update 1:** *Read [this tweet](https://twitter.com/modernizr/status/86521308854222848)
from the Modernizr team.*

Last week I installed [Seas0nPass](http://seas0npass.com/) on my
AppleTV2. And with it comes a Webkit-based browser app. Me being the
curious fellow I wanted to know how decent the support for the recent
browser technologies is in that app in order to get an idea what I
could do with that device. 

That's when I decided to put together a small website I could go to
from any browser on any device, and that would tell me what this 
browser is capable of. The result of about two hours of hackery is 
this: [haz.io](http://haz.io/).

It's very simple. I have a [JSON file](http://haz.io/capabilities.json)
with a list of features that should be tested for. I'm looping through
that with jQuery and building the HTML from it. Each item representing
one feature gets a class attribute with the feature name. Utilizing the
fact that Modernizr adds the same class names to the `<html>` element
and using some nice
[Sass trickery](https://github.com/philippbosch/haz/blob/92240ee236c0dfd2b14f/sass/screen.scss#L171-L189) 
I'm able to put either a green «Yep» or a red «Nope» next to each item.

I also threw in a bit of [responsiveness](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/)
in there in order to make the feature tables look nice on mobile devices.

**Update 2:** *I added support for [Jdrop](http://jdrop.org/) because I
wanted to be able to save the data from a mobile device and review it
on my computer. But unfortunately Steve Souders has not yet picked it
up so for now you'll get an error message when you press the «Jdrop» 
button at the bottom of the page.*

**Update 3:** *I recently removed Jdrop support again because I was
unable to find the time to implement it properly. And maybe it wasn't
such a good idea to begin with. Thanks, Steve, for your support 
anyways.*

What do you think about haz.io? Let me know in the comments.
