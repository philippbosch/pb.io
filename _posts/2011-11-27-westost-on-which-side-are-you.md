For a long time I've been wanting to do this. Now I finally found the time.

I've been living in Berlin for exactly five years now. As you probably know this city was divided into two parts by the Berlin Wall from 1961 until 1989. Nowadays there are almost no relics of the wall anymore. For I live only a few hundred meters from the former inner-city border, often times when I wander around here I ask myself on which side of the wall I would be if it still existed.

For that reason I created [West || Ost](http://westost.io/). It's a simple web app for your mobile phone, and it will tell you if you are in the former Western or Eastern part of Berlin (or that you are not in Berlin at all) – nothing more, nothing less. I hope it is of use for someone else. 

iOS users: add the app to your homescreen to see it in all its minimalistic glory.
